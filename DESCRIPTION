Description: Does prediction in the case of a censored survival outcome, or a regression outcome, using the "supervised principal component" approach (Bair et al., 2006, <doi:10.1198/016214505000000628>). Superpc is especially useful for high-dimensional data when the number of features _p_ dominates the number of samples n (p >> n paradigm), as generated, for instance, by high-throughput technologies.
