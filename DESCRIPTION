Description: Does prediction in the case of a censored survival outcome, or a regression outcome, using the "supervised principal component" approach. Superpc is especially useful for high-dimensional data when the number of features p dominates the number of samples n (p >> n paradigm), as generated, for instance, by high-throughput technologies.
Depends: R (>= 3.5.0)
Imports: survival, stats, graphics, grDevices
